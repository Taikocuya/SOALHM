Prerequisites
-------------

* [GCRebuilder](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/619/)
* PAL image of Skies of Arcadia Legends

Download
--------

* You can get the latest official release from the SourceForge releases:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/soalhm/files/latest/download
* You can also get the current development version from the GitHub repository:
  https://github.com/Taikocuya/SOALHM

Installation
------------

1. Put the files to some directory where you want it.
2. Start GCRebuilder and extract the PAL image file (ISO or GCM) of Skies of 
   Arcadia Legends. Please do not ask for a download link. You obtain a `root`

   extracted `root` directory.
4. Save and rebuild the new image with GCRebuilder.

Tips and Tricks
---------------

* Do not escape from any battle. You need the experience points.
* Get all treasure chests. You need every item.
* Buy the best weapons, armors and accessories which you can get.
* Buy healing and buff items to be prepared for difficult battles.
* Learn Delta Shield for Aika as fast as possible and use it wisely.
* Learn Lunar Blessing for Fina as fast as possible and use it for tough 
  fights.
* Learn Sacrulen for Fina as fast as possible or, at the latest when you 
  obtain the Delphinus.
* Some enemies are immune against physical attacks. Use magic with Aika and 
  Fina instead.
* Learn Pirates' Wrath for Vyse not later than before the fight against 
  Dralkor Tank as well as Dralkor Lacus.
* Learn Justice Shield for Enrique as fast as possible or, at the latest when 
  you arrive Yafutoma. Use it wisely to protect your party.
* Learn Lunar Light for Fina not later than before the fight against Tortigar.
* Destroy Obispo, Roc, Alania and Giant Looper as fast as possible to get rare 
  items.
* Recruit every crew member as fast as possible - especially Ryu-kan and 
  Ilchymis.
* Once you've recruited Ilchymis, buy Paranta Seeds for Vyse to increase his 
  Power.
* You need Enrique and his Justice Shield in every non-story line wanted 
  battle as well as against Piastol and Ramirez. Normally, you can't win the 
  fights with Drachma or Gilder.
